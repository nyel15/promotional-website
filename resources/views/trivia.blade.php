    <ol>
        <li class="fw-bold">Palawan is the largest province in the Philippines by land area</li>
        <p> - It has an area of 17,030.75 square kms, according to the Philippine Statistics Authority. This includes
            Puerto Princesa City, the provincial capital and the country's second largest city by land area, after Davao
            City. Despite being Palawan's capital, Puerto Princesa is a highly-urbanized city and is not
            administratively part of the province.</p>
        <li class="fw-bold">Palawan may be split into 3 provinces if voters there will approve the division</li>
        <p> - In April 2019, President Rodrigo Duterte signed Republic Act 11259 dividing Palawan into
            3: Palawan del
            Norte, Palawan Oriental, and Palawan del Sur. Puerto Princesa City will not be part of any province
            administratively.</p>
        <li class="fw-bold">Palawan is home to one of the New 7 Wonders of Nature</li>
        <p>The Puerto Princesa Underground River contains a stunning network of subterranean rivers and cave systems. It
            is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site.The national park for the underground river is teeming with various
            plant and animal species. The area “also represents a significant habitat for biodiversity conservation,”
            said UNESCO in its website.</p>
        <li class="fw-bold">Tourist arrivals in Palawan picked up in 2018</li>
        <p>A total of 1,809,880 tourists visited Palawan in 2018, up by 21% versus 2017, reported Palawan Daily News,
            citing data from the province's tourism department. Around 6 out of 10 tourists in 2018 were domestic
            travelers, while the rest were foreigners.</p>
        <li class="fw-bold">Palawan hasn't been hit by a destructive earthquake at least since 1907</li>
        <p>A map by the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) shows that from 1907 to 2012,
            Palawan has not been visited by destructive earthquakes. (The closest are some earthquakes near the northern
            part of Palawan, around Busuanga and Coron islands.) </p>
