    <h1 class="fw-bold">discovering the rich history of palawan</h1>
    <p>Delve into the rich and fascinating history of Palawan, an island in the western Philippines
        that has been
        inhabited for thousands of years. From ancient times to colonization by the Spanish and Japanese invasion during
        World War II, Palawan's history is a tapestry of cultural influences and historical events that have shaped the
        island's unique identity. In this article, we will explore the rich history of Palawan and learn about the many
        factors that have contributed to the island's rich cultural heritage.</p>

    <h5 class="fw-bold mt-3">Tabon Cave and ancient time</h5>
    <p>Tabon Cave is a limestone cave complex located in Lipuun Point, Quezon, Palawan, in the Philippines. It is one of
        the most important archaeological sites in the country and has yielded numerous artifacts and remains that shed
        light on the ancient history of the Philippines and Southeast Asia.</p>
    <p>The cave complex was first discovered in 1936 by an American archaeologist named Robert Fox. Fox conducted
        extensive excavations at the site, unearthing a wealth of prehistoric artifacts and skeletal remains that date
        back to around 50,000 years ago. It is believed that Palawan's first inhabitants were migrants who reached
        Palawan during a period when sea levels were lower and land bridges connected the different islands in the
        region.</p>
    <h5 class="fw-bold mt-3">Pre-colonial time</h5>
    <p>Palawan's earliest settlers are believed to be the ancestors of the Palaw'ans and Tagbanuas people, who have
        evolved unique cultures over time. They have established their own alphabet and trade system with sea-borne
        merchants, which adds to their distinctiveness. These communities have also developed an informal form of
        governance that has been passed down through generations, further cementing their place as the original
        inhabitants of this beautiful island paradise.</p>
    <p>There is evidence showing that the island's inhabitants were already engaged in commerce with ancient Chinese
        traders. The coastal areas of Calamianes were particularly active in this trade, as demonstrated by the vast
        collection of Chinese porcelain, jars, and other relics that have been discovered in Palawan today. These
        historical records paint a vivid picture of a thriving early civilization that flourished through the exchange
        of goods and ideas, long before the arrival of the colonizers.</p>

    <h5 class="fw-bold mt-3">Spanish rule</h5>
    <p>The Calamianes Islands located in the northern part of Palawan were among the first to be colonized by the
        Spanish, which declared the area a separate province from the Palawan mainland. In the early 17th century,
        Spanish friars attempted to establish missions in several other towns such as Cuyo, Agutaya, Taytay, and
        Cagayancillo. However, they were met with resistance from the Moro communities. By the 18th century, Spain began
        constructing fortified churches to serve as a base for preaching and as a defense against Moro raids in Cuyo,
        Taytay, Linapacan, and Balabac. Many of these structures still exist today, offering a glimpse into Palawan's
        colorful past.</p>
    <p>In 1749, the Sultanate of Borneo ceded southern Palawan to Spain, which then established its control over the
        entire province. Originally, Palawan was a single province named Calamianes, with Taytay as its capital. Later
        on, it was divided into three provinces: Castilla in the northern section with Taytay as capital, Asturias in
        the southern mainland with Puerto Princesa as capital, and Balabac Island with its capital in the town of
        Principe Alfonso.</p>
    <img src="img/historyImg/american-rule.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded">
    <h5 class="fw-bold mt-3">American rule</h5>
    <p>After the Peace Treaty between Spain and the United States in 1898, the American regime took over Palawan. In
        1901, a Military Government led by Major John Brown was established, and in June 23, 1902, the Civil Government
        of Paragua was established with Major J. Brown as the appointed Governor. Following the implementation of Act
        No. 1363 of the Philippine Commission in 1905, the name of the province was changed from Paragua to Palawan, and
        the capital was transferred from Cuyo to Puerto Princesa.</p>
    <p>However, on May 18, 1942, the Japanese Imperial Forces occupied Palawan during World War II. Garrisons were
        established in Coron, Puerto Princesa, and Iwahig, leading to the formation of guerilla forces in three sectors.
        Capt. Carlos Amores led the Calamianes sector, Dr. Higinio Mendoza, Sr. (Governor elect 1931-1937) led the Main
        Island, and Emilio Tumbaga led Brooke's Point. Palawan was liberated by the Americans in 1945.</p>
    <h5 class="fw-bold mt-3">Palawan Massacre: A Tragic WWII Event</h5>
    <p>The Palawan Massacre was a brutal event that occurred on December 14, 1944, during World War II. The Japanese
        Fourteenth Area Army under the command of General Tomoyuki Yamashita herded 150 prisoners of war in Puerto
        Princesa into three covered trenches and set them on fire using gasoline to prevent their rescue by advancing
        American allies. Prisoners who tried to escape the flames were shot down, while others who attempted to climb
        over a cliff were hunted down and killed. Only 11 soldiers survived, and between 133 to 141 people were killed.
    </p>
    <p>The event is the basis for the book “Last Man Out: Glenn McDole, USMC, Survivor of the Palawan Massacre in World
        War II” by Bob Wilbanks and the opening scenes of the 2005 Miramax film “The Great Raid.” A memorial now stands
        on the site, known as Plaza Cuartel, next to the Cathedral in Puerto Princesa. McDole, one of the survivors, was
        able to attend the dedication in his eighties.</p>
